David Kindersley's spacing methods
==================================

In the 1950s, Kindersley began (researching)[http://www.kindersleyworkshop.co.uk/spacing/] methods to find the
"optical center" of glyphs&mdash;in other words, the point at which
the left and right sides of the glyph "appear" balanced to the eye.

This work was a rare foray into trying to experimentally determine
what underlying factors might be at work when designers visually
adjust spacing for perceptual balance.

Kindersley's initial approach was to project light through cut outs of
glyphs, and measure the actual amount of light that fell on each side
of a dividing line.  Adjusting the divider could easily find the
midpoint at which an equal amount of light fell on the left and right,
meaning that there was an equal "grayness" (or black-to-white ratio,
perhaps) between the two sides.

It was immediately clear that this equal-energy dividing line was
*not* the optical center, however; the question was to determine what
adjustments to the measurements produced optically balanced spacing.

Kindersley determined that this method produced acceptable results
only if the grayness measurements were taken with the center of the
glyph masked off; the opacity and degree to which the center of a
glyph should be masked off for optimal results was the focus of the
research.  He experimentally tested this method with a variety of
typefaces, including uprights and Italics.


Balance theory
--------------

Kindersley knew from practical experience that the midpoint between
a glyph's two extrema was not the location of the optical axis.  He
looked at four other axes, which he described as:

1. area
2. first moment (gravity)
3. second moment (inertia)
4. third moment (optical?)

Kindersley's terminology is, at times, problematic, due to the fact
that several different geometrical and statistical properties are
sometimes referred to, informally, in similar-sounding terms.  It is not
always obvious which property Kindersley is describing.

The "area" axis seems to
correspond to the x-axis location of the geometric median&mdash;the line
that divides the glyph into two sets of equal area.

The "first moment" seems to correspond to the geometric mean or
centroid, which (for solids of uniform density) corresponds to the
center of mass.  

The "second moment" seems to correspond to the planar second moment of
area with respect to the y axis.

Following this progression, the "third moment" seems to be the
integral of the differential area multiplied by the cube of the
distance to the y-axis.



initially suspected that the optical center of a glyph
would be not on the axis through its center of mass, but through its
third moment center.



"Quite simply I mean that each letter should appear to be exactly in
the centre between its two neighbours. To me this is the only
criterion, and I do not believe that it requires any further
justification. Put another way, any letter should occupy a passive
position between its neighbours"


He noted that ascenders and descenders do not seem to contribute to the
location of the optical center (i.e., h and n have the same center, as
do v and y).  Instead, the optical centering happens within the
x-height rectangle.
