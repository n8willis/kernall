David Kindersley's spacing methods
==================================

In the 1950s, Kindersley began researching methods to find the
"optical center" of glyphs&mdash;in other words, the point at which
the left and right sides of the glyph "appear" balanced to the eye.

This work was a rare foray into trying to experimentally determine
what underlying factors might be at work when designers visually
adjust spacing for perceptual balance.

Kindersley's initial approach was to project light through cut outs of
glyphs, and measure the actual amount of light that fell on each side
of a dividing line.  Adjusting the divider could easily find the
midpoint at which an equal amount of light fell on the left and right,
meaning that there was an equal "grayness" (or black-to-white ratio,
perhaps) between the two sides.

It was immediately clear that this equal-energy dividing line was
*not* the optical center, however; the question was to determine what
adjustments to the measurements produced optically balanced spacing.

Kindersley determined that this method produced acceptable results
only if the grayness measurements were taken with the center of the
glyph masked off; the opacity and degree to which the center of a
glyph should be masked off for optimal results was the focus of the
research.  He experimentally tested this method with a variety of
typefaces, including uprights and Italics.
