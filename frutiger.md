The Adrian Frutiger approach to spacing
=======================================

Frutiger's approach, as expressed informally in [his
comments](http://www.linotype.com/793-12659/walterkaechs.html) about
Walter KÃ¤ch, says simply that "the interior spaces (counters) of the
lower-case letters had the identical width of the spaces between the
letters."  Frutiger noted that he had designed all of his serif typefaces
according to this rule.
