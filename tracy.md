The Walter Tracy method of spacing letters
==========================================

In his book 'Letters of Credit', Walter Tracy defines a basic system
for spacing Latin lowercase and uppercase letters.  Each case begins
with a control character and defines a small set of spacing values
from it, which are then assigned to the left- and right-side bearings
of other letters.

For the lowercase letters, the control character is *n*.  The space
between the stems in *n*, divided by 2, is the starting point.
